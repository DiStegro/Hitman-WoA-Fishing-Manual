# Hitman World of Assassination Fishing Manual
Hitman World of Assassination is a game where you get to be an assassin, sneak into places, use disguises and smack your target with a fish with no one being any the wiser. Of course, you'll have to find the fish first

Honestly, this is a mediocre randomiser at best, all the checks are located very close together and goal is almost entirely separate from earning checks. But I wanted to see if it would work, it does, and some people showed interest, so here we are.

## Randomized Items
- Missions
- Starting items

Send locations by finding fish to collect in the levels. I heavily recommend using [hitmaps.com](https://www.hitmaps.com/) to locate the fish/starfish in each mission. 

## Victory Goal
Victory is achieved by smacking each main mission target with a fish. There are locations in the manual to facilitate tracking which you've done, these cannot hold useful items, or items from another world. Opportunities are varied enough for these that they will show as in-logic as soon as you have access to the mission, however there is plenty of room for you to wait for your preferred strategy before goaling.


### Additional Notes
- "Shadows in the Water - Eastern Beach Fish" is evasive, and you'll have to catch them as they swim away. Backing up and waiting for a short time will give you another chance.
- Logic is tight enough that I've been able to acquire each fish while maintaining Silent Assassin, however I consider this as an extra challenge mode than a strict requirement.
